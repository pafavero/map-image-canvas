<p>Usually a web map application shows a background map, overlapped by markers or vector elements (eg. points, lines, polygons)</p>
<p>I investigated the possibility to use icons which are not dinamically generated or connect external labels with markers.</p>
<p>A possible approach could consist in the use of external JS library to cover the map canvas. Ol3 offers a class <a href="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.14.0/apidoc/ol.source.ImageCanvas.html"> ImageCanvas</a> which supports the overlay with drawn generated content</p>
